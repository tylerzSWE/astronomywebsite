            <h2>The 6 Types</h2>
           
            <h3>Cosomolgy</h3>
            
            <p>Cosmologists study the structure, eveolution and other properties of the universe on a larger scale. They also study the origin of the universe, they look at things like the Big Bang Theory(the most widely accepted theory of how everything started). Including this they also study cosmic background radiation, background radiation is remnants of the primordial universe.</p>
           
            <h3>Observational Astronomy</h3>

            <p>This branch of astronomy focuses more on gathering a lot of physical data through directly observing celestial bodies with the help of different instruments. These instruments include cameras on their telescopes, spectrographs which breaks light down in the same way a prism splits the rainbow, and interfermeters which help telecopes stablize and measure the brightness of stars. </p>

            <h3>Galactic Astronomy</h3>

            <p>Galactic astronomers strongly focus on the study of galaxies and their properties. These properties include a galaxies star system, planets, gas, dust and dark matter. For those who do not know dark matter is a hypothetical form of matter that doesn't interact with light and has gravitational effects on regular matter.</p>
            
            <h3>Planetary Astronomy</h3>

            <p>Planetary astronomy hone in on studying planets, moons, comets, asteroids and other space junk in our solar system and also study other planets in our solar system and different solar systems to see if they support life. </p>

            <h3>Stellar Astronomy</h3>
            
            <p>Stellar astronomy is study of stars like our Sun and other stars. They also study the cycle, properties of stars and the after life of stars. Certain properties of stars include temperature, luminosity ot brightness and composotion.</p>

            <h3>Theorectial Astronomy</h3>

            <p>This type of astronomy heavily uses mathmatical models, different types of simulations to run tests on things outside of our solar system and beyond. They use results of these studies and create theories based of off research.</p>
