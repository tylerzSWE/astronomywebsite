    <p>The main way stars die is they either collapse in on themselves and create a supernova, or burn all their fuel and become a white or red dwarf which are these small little stars that generate little brightness.</p>

    <h2>Black Holes and Neutron Stars</h2>
    
    <p>A black hole and neutron star are like two sides of a coin of the same coin, they have their similiarities but they are ultimately different</p>

    <h3>Black Holes

    </h3>

    <p>Black holes are some of the most fascinating things in space because so little is known about them. The main property that defines a black hole is an area of space where gravity is so strong not even light can escape. They come of form when a star becomes giant abou 2 or 3 solar masses. For those who don't know 1 solar mass is about 330,000 times the mass of our Earth. So these stars are massive. When this star reaches the end of its life span, by that I mean the star has fused all the elements up until iron and the harsh gravity makes the star implodes and collapsing in on itself and all the guts of the star are spit out in a MASSIVE explosion called a supernova. Some black holes are truely hard to wrap your mind around the size of it. The most famous one is Phoenix A which is 100 BILLION solar masses! On average black holes are 3-10 solar masses. Lastly black holes bend time and space as we know it, if you were to go near a black hole you would see time warp and slow down. This is known as time dilation.</p> 


    <h3>Neutron Stars

    </h3>
    
    <p>A neutron star is the opposite of a black hole. They are the result of a star being too small to create a black hole but still are extremely dense. In comparsion they are extremely small only about 30 meters in radius, but they are more dense then our Sun and spin 716 times which is faster then blades of a kitchen blender. They are so dense in fact that one teaspoon of neutron star material weighs 10 million tons!</p>
